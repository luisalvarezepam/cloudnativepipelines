# Stage review requirements

As it was mentioned before all tasks must be completed for successful completion of the stage and as a result of your work the following requirements must be met:

- Stage [Artifact(s)](#artifacts) must be attached to the learn portal and approved by mentor.
- Present the result of your work during the [Demonstration Session](#demonstration-sessions).
- [Common Requirements](#common-requirements) must be met.

## Artifacts

**Artifact** is an important part of the work, because it helps to hand work results over to other team members and keep work results as a knowledge base. Each following work stage is based on the previous one: High Level Architecture based on Requirements, Low Level Architecture based on High Level Architecture, Configuration and Implementation based on Low Level Architecture, etc.

According to our course **Stage Artifacts** is one of the results of the work. They help to evaluate what was done, as well as sequence of implementation processes.

The list below provides some **Stage Artifact** examples:

- High-Level Design (HLD).
- Low-Level Design (LLD).
- Diagrams and flowcharts.
- Screenshots.
- Other options that you consider necessary.

## Demonstration Sessions

**Demonstration session** is a part of the **Stage Review** where mentee presents the results of the work. The number of demonstration sessions do not have to be equal the number of stages. However, all tasks which was done during the course must be presented during demo sessions. Some of the stages could be combined to be presented during a single stage review because of the common scope.

Demonstration session procedure should include the following steps:

**Preparation**

- Request a review on the learning portal if applicable and join the **Stage review** (Stage Demo) call with mentor. (_Please take into account that the call will be assigned based on yours and mentor's calendars that could take several days between the request and conducted stage review call._)
- Make sure that mentor has **Reader** permissions for your Azure DevOps projects and your Azure subscription.
- Make sure that all entities are deployed before demonstration session (infrastructure, applications, etc.).

:warning: ***Note:*** All entities must be deployed and configured automatically without manual interventions in the Azure Cloud Portal. Manually created components would not be considered as a positive result of demo session.

**Demonstration session**

- Mentee briefly represents key aspects of HLD and LLD.
- Demonstrates the latest successful pipeline(s) run.
- Demonstrates that updated configuration(s) works.
- Summarize the approach(es) by providing pros and cons.
- Q&A session.

:warning: ***Note:*** Recommended duration of the presentation is 5 minutes, presentation shouldn't lasts more than 10 minutes.

## Common Requirements

This section describes key requirements for completing tasks, it means that mentors focus their attention on the following points:

- All tasks must be completed. The progress must be reflected in work items.
- Solution follows best practices.
- All sensitive data are kept properly.
- All entities have been deployed and configured automatically without manual interventions or adjustments via Azure portal.
- Pipelines' triggers, gates, and approvals have been configured in appropriate way.
- All infrastructure components and applications are available according to the task.
