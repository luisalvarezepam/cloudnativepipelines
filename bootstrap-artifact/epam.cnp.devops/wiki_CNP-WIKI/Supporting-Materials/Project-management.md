# Introduction

In order to improve quality of the delivery and customer satisfaction we need to focus on the customer's needs and desires throughout product delivery in Agile way. This means that apart from the fact that we eventually need to deliver the requested solution in a consistent way, we should also illuminate the whole delivery process through the project lifecycle. 

**Main goals** in that process are:

* Improve client's satisfaction
* Improve quality of the delivery
* Measure success.
* Provide continuous reports
