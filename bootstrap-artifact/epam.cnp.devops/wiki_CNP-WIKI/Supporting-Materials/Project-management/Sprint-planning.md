# What is Sprint Planning?
**Sprint Planning** is one of important event in Sprint. It kicks off the Sprint, defines Sprint goal and how that goal will be achieved. But how we can identify scope of work we should do within upcoming sprint? Well, there are some questions which can be helpful:
- What is valuable for this Sprint?
- How much work should be done for this value?
- Will this value have impact on already working system?

Usually sprint planning relies on the following:
1. **Business goals and priorities.** What is the goal for this sprint? What is the priority for selected goals? What product backlog items are ready and contribute toward the sprint goal?
1. **Capacity.** What is the team’s capacity based on everyone’s availability? Identify any vacations, holidays, other activities that will impact everyone’s availability during the sprint.
1. **Estimations.** What items will the team include on the sprint backlog based on the sprint goal and the team’s capacity. How confident does the team feel that they’ll be able to meet the sprint goal.

# How to implement Scrum practices in Azure Boards?
Azure Boards make it possible for the team to keep track of assignments to understand how goals and tasks are going. The general sequence of steps for implementing Scrum using Azure Boards is as follows:

1. ## Configure teams and sprints
   * [Define iteration paths (sprints) and configure team iterations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/settings/set-iteration-paths-sprints?view=azure-devops)
   * [Define area paths and assign to a team](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/settings/set-area-paths?view=azure-devops) (Optional)
   * [Create or add a team](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/settings/add-teams?view=azure-devops)
   * [Define team sprints and set the default iteration path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/settings/set-iteration-paths-sprints?view=azure-devops&tabs=browser#activate)

1. ## Create team backlog
   * [Create your product backlog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/create-your-backlog?view=azure-devops)
   * [Forecast your product backlog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/sprints/forecast?view=azure-devops) (Optional)

1. ## Implement a sprint
   * [Assign backlog items to a sprint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/sprints/assign-work-sprint?view=azure-devops)
   * [Add tasks to backlog items](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/sprints/add-tasks?view=azure-devops)
   * [Set sprint capacity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/sprints/set-capacity?view=azure-devops)
   * [Adjust work to fit sprint capacity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/sprints/adjust-work?view=azure-devops)
   * [Share your sprint plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/sprints/share-plan?view=azure-devops) (Optional)
   * [Update the Taskboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/sprints/task-board?view=azure-devops)
