# Introduction

In order to improve quality of the delivery and customer satisfaction we need to focus on the customer's needs and desires throughout product delivery in Agile way. This means that apart from the fact that we eventually need to deliver the requested solution in a consistent way, we should also illuminate the whole delivery process through the project lifecycle. 

**Main goals** in that process are:

* Improve client's satisfaction
* Improve quality of the delivery
* Measure success.
* Provide continuous reports

# Delivery Plan

**ToDo:** add relevant CNP project diagram

# Common Requirements

* Visualize delivery management by managing tasks via tracking system and providing reporting.  
* Use full stack of Azure DevOps Services to represent the product delivery and project management.  
* Follow Agile best practices.  
* Follow DevOps best practices.  

# Project Management Setup

Ensure all customer's requirements are covered with appropriate Product Backlog Items (PBIs) created on project's board:  

* Transfer project plan defined in Work breakdown structure (WBS) to the Azure Boards. [CSS WBS file](/.attachments/WBS_CNP.xlsx).
* Apply appropriate PBI strategy for that purpose, defined in WBS.  

Ensure proper project planning and reflect this on Azure Boards:  

* Configure Agile/Scrum workflow.  
* Estimate delivery timelines by specifying appropriate effort required to deliver each feature/story (use for reference [Estimation techniques](/Supporting-Materials/Project-management/Estimation-techniques)).
* Define priorities for each feature/story based on the delivery plan.
* Create and configure sprints on Azure Boards.
* Make sprint(s) planning by splitting product delivery plan on several phases (sprints), taking into an account business priorities and team capacity (use for reference: [Sprint planning](/Supporting-Materials/Project-management/Sprint-planning)).
* Start with the 1st sprint. 

Measure delivery and report your progress by creating online reports with Azure Dashboards (use for reference: [Reporting](/Supporting-Materials/Project-management/Reporting)):  

* Create and configure dashboard to <u>report delivered functionality in each delivery phase (Sprint burndown chart)</u>.
* Create and configure dashboard to <u>report delivery trend over the whole project delivery (Sprint velocity chart)</u>.
* Create and configure dashboard to <u>report amount of delivered functionality over the time (amount of features per state)</u>.
